\section{Coloured Petri Nets}
Common usage: Process and protocol modeling, concurrent programming. Operations:
Simulation, verification and analysis. More recently also software design.

Short intro to places, transitions and arcs?

\section{CPN Tools}

Graphical tool used to design CPN models. 

Reference, with url

\subsection{Standard ML}

Functional language. (Ref)
Give examples

\section{WebSocket}

This section is about the WebSocket
protocol \cite{draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol}.

\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} is the top-level overview of the WebSocket
protocol as a CPN model. 

Resembles part of OSI model (ref), where top level is levels 6 and 7, middle
level is level 5, and bottom level is levels 4 through 1. Two-way communication
between levels.

Circles represent places. Double-bordered
recangles represent subpages, and will be further detailed.

\subsection{Client Application}

Laid out from top to bottom to loosely show sequence. 

Bottom places represent interface to WebSocket library.

Send and receive data

Here we see an enabled transition at the top. If we were to fire this
transition, it would produce a MESSAGE token in the Send Client Message place.
