\section{Thesis Aim}

This thesis seeks to create a framework for annotating CPNs. The framework
should be capable of choosing different sets of pragmatics, which are
categorised into General, Domain Specific and Example Specific Pragmatics.

It should be possible to import CPN models created in CPN Tools. Annotations are
placed through a tree editor, and also, if possible, through a graphical diagram
editor. Errors highlighting?

Finally, there should be an easy way to invoke the code generator from the
editor.
