\section{Thesis Aim}

This thesis seeks to create a framework for annotating CPNs. The framework
should be capable of choosing different sets of pragmatics, which are
categorised into General, Domain Specific and Example Specific Pragmatics.

It should be possible to import CPN models created in CPN Tools. Annotations are
placed through a tree editor, and also, if possible, through a graphical diagram
editor. Errors highlighting?

Finally, there should be an easy way to invoke the code generator from the
editor.

\section{Structure}

The thesis is described below:

\begin{description}
\item[Chapter~\ref{chap:background}:~\nameref{chap:background}] Introduction to
CPN, showing how to use it by using the WebSocket protocol as an example.
Overview of related research. Describe CPN Tools.
\item [Chapter~\ref{chap:technology}:~\nameref{chap:technology}] Explanation of
the Eclipse Platform and its modules, which make up the foundation of our
prototype
\item [Chapter~\ref{chap:analysis}:~\nameref{chap:analysis}] Discussion and
detailing of requirements for the editor. Overview and explanation of test cases.
\item [Chapter~\ref{chap:implementation}:~\nameref{chap:implementation}]
Describe how the implementation works. Explanation of chosen solutions to requirements. 
\item [Chapter~\ref{chap:evaluation}:~\nameref{chap:evaluation}] Discuccion on
which requirements have been met. Results from test cases and feedback from
users.
\item [Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}:~\nameref{chap:conclusion}] Summary,
personal experience, limitations and suggested focus of future work.
