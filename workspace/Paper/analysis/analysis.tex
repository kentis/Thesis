\chapter{Analysis, Design and Implementation}
\label{chap:analysis}

Our analysis of available software solutions and platforms in the previous
chapter showed that the basic primitives that are required to develop the
desired code generation pragmatic framework are available as part of the Eclipse
eco-system. It is therefore natural to develop \thename{} as an Eclipse Plugin
and base all software develpoment in the context of this thesis on the Eclipse
Platform.

\section{The CPN Ontology with Pragmatics}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:ontologies}, Pragmatics are defined and modeled
as ontologies, using the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language.  

There exists two ontologies that function as a base for pragmatics: One that
defines Coloured Petri Nets, and one that defines basic classes for pragmatics.
The ontology defining CPN will be explained in several parts, with line
numbering continuing across parts.

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cpn.owl:start,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,firstline=1,lastline=5,float,
caption=The CPN Ontology: Opening]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/cpn.fowl}

\lstref{owl:start} shows the beginning of the CPN ontology. Every ontology must
be declared with |Ontology()| containing an Internationalized Resource
Identifier (IRI) and a series of declarations and axioms. IRI is a
generalization of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to allow all Unicode
characters to be used. An IRI can point to an actual resource on the Internet,
but is not required to do so. Each concept in an ontology is also identified
with an IRI, but to avoid repetition we define ``:`` as a prefix representing
this document's IRI (line 1). Prefixes can also be declared for other
ontologies, and some (like owl: and xsd:) are predefined (and stated on lines 2
and 3 for clarity). 

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cpn.owl:base,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,firstline=7,lastline=42,float,firstnumber=7,
caption=The CPN Ontology: Base Classes]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/cpn.fowl} 

Inside the
|Ontology()| declaration we write declarations and axioms to describe the
domain. \lstref{cpn.owl:base} shows the first such declarations. Whitespace and
indentation is syntactically irrelevant and only used for readability. We first
declare the class |:ColouredPetriNet| (line 7). We then
declare the object property |:pages|, and restrict its domain to |:ColouredPetriNet| and its range
to |:Page|\footnote{Note that both Access/CPN and ePNK use the term Page instead
of Module, so for convenience we will also use the term Page in the
implementation of \thename{}.} (lines 8-10). This means that there exists a
property |:pages|, that instances of |:ColouredPetriNet| can have this property,
and that the value of the property must be a |:Page|. The class |:Page| is
defined just below on line 12, but the order of declaration is not important, as
the whole document must be loaded before any processing or reasoning can be performed on
the ontology. Also note that there are two kinds of properties:
Object (which range must be a class) and Data (which range must be a datatype
primitive, like string or integer, defined in the xsd: ontology).

We then continue declaring all model elements in a similar manner. A |:Page| can
have many |:elements|. An |:Element| has a |:page|. Line 23 states
|SubClassOf(:Element ObjectMaxCardinality(1 :page))|, meaning an :Element can
have at most 1 |:page|.
Line 22 states |InverseObjectProperties(:page :elements)|, defining these
properties as inversely related. An example consequence of this is if we define
an individual |:Element| and specify its |:page|, it is implicitly known that
the |:Page| contains that individual in its |:elements|. An |:Element| can also
have an |:id|.

Lines 29-42 describe the class |:Node| as a subclass of :Element with a |:name|
property and |:in| and |:out| properties for connected |:Arc|s.

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cpn.owl:place,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,firstline=44,lastline=55,float,firstnumber=44,
caption=The CPN Ontology: Place Class]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/cpn.fowl} 

\lstref{cpn.owl:place} shows declarations relating to the |:Place| class, and
follows the same pattern as the earlier classes to describe the properties |:sort| and
|:initialMarking|.

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cpn.owl:trans,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,firstline=57,lastline=75,float,firstnumber=57,
caption=The CPN Ontology: Transition Classes]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/cpn.fowl} 

\lstref{cpn.owl:trans} shows declarations relating to the |:Transition| and
|:SubstitutionTransition| classes.

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cpn.owl:arc,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,firstline=77,lastline=96,float,firstnumber=77,
caption=The CPN Ontology: Arc Class]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/cpn.fowl} 

\lstref{cpn.owl:arc} shows declarations relating to the |:Arc| class. The
properties |:dest| and |:source| are declared as inverse of |:in| and |:out|
(from |:Node|).

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cpn.owl:disjoint,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,firstline=99,lastline=102,float,firstnumber=99,
caption=The CPN Ontology: Arc Class]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/cpn.fowl} 
Finally, \lstref{cpn.owl:disjoint} declare classes as disjoint. This is
neccessary, as ontologies by default use open world assumptions, meaning even though something is not
explicitly stated does not mean it isn't true. Thus, without these declarations,
it is possible for an individual to for instance be a :Place and an :Arc at the
same time. Thus, we need to ``close the world'' by defining classes as disjoint,
meaning a member of one class is never a member of any of the other classes in
the list.

\lstref{basic.owl} provides the base ontology for pragmatics. The purpose of the
base is to link CPN elements and pragmatic annotations. The specific pragmatics
that can be attached to CPN elements will be defined in subsequent ontologies.
 
\lstinputlisting[label=lst:basic.owl,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,
caption=The Basic Pragmatics Ontology]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/basic.fowl}

An ontology document can import other ontologies by referring to their IRI.  We
describe later how this is taken into account when loading ontology documents
from projects and plugins. In this ontology, we import the CPN Ontology (line 8)
and also assign it the prefix |cpn:| (line 5).

This ontology is much shorter than the CPN ontology, declaring only one new
class |:Pragmatic|, as well as its disjointness with other classes and its |:belongsTo| property. It
also declares the property |:hasPragmatic| for |cpn:Element|, and declares the
two properties as the inverse of each other.

Next, we have the ontology for the Generic pragmatics that provide the
fundamental set of pragmatics for the protocol domain. \com{Hvis tid, figurer}

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:nppn.owl,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,
caption=The Generic Pragmatics Ontology]
{D:/Documents/Master/Thesis/workspace/Ontologies/ontologies/generic/nppn.fowl}

This is the first ontology that defines actual usable pragmatics. The second
line of each pragmatic declaration is a form of property restriction. The first
one (line 14) states that a |:Principal| can only belong to a
|cpn:SubstitutionTransition|.

\com{Trenger litt mer info fra Kent om disse\ldots}
The |:External| pragmatic (line 22 and 23) shows why ontologies are well suited
for defining pragmatics. It can belong to |:TransitionConnectedToId|, which is a
complex class defined through a chain of classes. We first define |:IdPlace| on
line 40 to be equivalent to the set of individuals that are a |cpn:Place|, and
has a |:hasPragmatic| property with a value that is an instance of |:Id|, and
has exactly one |:hasPragmatic| property associated. In the same manner we
further define |:ArcFromId| on line 47 as anything that is a |cpn:Arc| coming
from an |:IdPlace|. Finally on line 54, a |:TransitionConnectedToId| must have
an incoming |:ArcFromId|. Alltogether this describes the circumstance where an
|:External| pragmatic can be placed, which is on any transition with an incoming
arc from a place annotated with an |:Id| pragmatic. We demonstrate the practical
effect of this on model annotation in Chapter \ref{chap:evaluation}.

\subsection{The Ontology Containment Project}
The ontologies described above are not subject to change by the user of \thename{},
and will always be available when annotating a model. We need a way to
conveniently provide them to the model, as well as utilities for managing them. For this purpose we
created a separate Eclipse plugin called Ontologies. It contains the ontology
documents, utility classes for listing all ontologies the plugin provides, the
PluginIRIMapper which can translate the IRI of import statements to the ontology
documents available in the plugin, and the OntologyLoader, which creates a
manager and includes the PluginIRIMapper automatically.

It also includes the OWL API and HermiT jar files, and exports their packages to
let other plugins use them. This gives a central point of upgrading should it be
desired in the future.

\section{The Annotated CPN model type for ePNK}
While designing the ePNK Petri Net Type model for \thename{}, it was decided to
separate it into two parts: One to define a CPN Type that corresponds to CPN
Tools including the various inscriptions and model constraints, and one
for defining an Annotated CPN Type, extending from the first and capturing how
pragmatics relate to elements of the CPN Type model.
This also adds the benefit that the CPN Type can be used in other
applications.

A custom Petri Net Type needs to be contained in an Eclipse Plugin project.
Such a project will contain configuration files that define the properties and
capabilities of the plugin. These files include MANIFEST.MF for declaring plugin
name, version and dependencies, plugin.xml for defining extensions and extension
points, and build.properties for defining build parameters. The Eclipse Plugin
IDE includes an editor for editing all three files in a convenient user
interface with guides and content assistance.

After creating a plugin project, an EMF model should be created. This is the
Type Model, and should inherit the PNML Core Model from ePNK, or any other model
that already does this (such as the P/T-Net or HLPNG Types\footnote{These
ePNK Types were briefly introduced in Section \ref{sec:epnk}}).
We will refer to the PNML Core Model as the Core Model.

\subsection{CPN Type Model}
The CPN Type model is shown in \figref{cpn_model_diagram}, and defines the
structure and constraints of Coloured Petri Nets. The first thing a new Type
model should define is a subclass of the PetriNetType class from the Core Model
(we will refer to this as the Core Type), with the name of the new Type, which in
our case is CPN. This can be seen in the top left corner of the diagram in
\figref{cpn_model_diagram}. This class is used to identify the Type, and is
what will appear in the menu to let a user extend a model with the new Type.
\com{Oppdater figurer! }
\fig{CPNDefinition.pdf}{CPN model type diagram}{cpn_model_diagram}


EMF does not support merging of models, meaning it is not possible to define new
properties or relations directly on the original classes of the Core Model.
Thus, in order to change the functionality of existing classes such as Place,
Arc and Page, they have to be subclassed. ePNK uses reflection to check a
Type Model for subclasses with the same name as classes in the Core Type, and
load these dynamically instead of the base classes.
This can be seen in \figref{cpn_model_diagram}, where Place, Arc, Transition and
Page are all subclassed from the classes referenced from the Core Model, with
added relations to inscription classes.

To represent the different inscriptions of a CPN model, we define classes that
inherit the Label class from the Core Model. From a data modeling
perspective, it would make more sense to make inscriptions simple
string attributes of the classes they belong to, but the Label class includes
functionality required for displaying in the graphical diagram editor of ePNK.
The different inscription classes are identical implementation-wise, but have
different names to be distinguishable in the user editor context menu for adding
child elements.

\subsection{Code generation}
After creating the CPN Type model, EMF can generate source code for interfaces
and implementations of the new classes. This is done by creating a ``genfile''
linked to the EMF model. The genfile can define metainfo such as the base
package of generated source files, and configuration parameters for the
individual classes. EMF can then generate different groups of code, but for an
ePNK Type we only need Model code and Edit code. the Model code includes
interfaces and corresponding basic implementations of the classes as well as
factories for instantiating them, while the Edit code contains classes for
presenting and manipulating the model in an editor.

After generating the code for the Type Model, the source file for
the implementation of the PetriNetType subclass needs two minor modifications
to work with ePNK: The constructor must be made public (it is protected by
default), and the toString method must be implemented to conform to the
PetriNetType interface. This method should return a string that textually
represents the net type, usually simply its formal name.

Before ePNK will recognise the plugin and the Type Model, the plugin manifest
needs to be edited to define this plugin as an extension to the
org.pnml.tools.epnk.pntd extension point of ePNK. All that is needed to
configure this is supplying a unique id, a descriptive name, and the fully
qualified classpath to the PetriNetType subclass. The resulting
element in plugin.xml is shown in \lstref{pntd_xml}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML,label=lst:pntd_xml,float,
caption=ePNK Petri Net Type Definition Extension]
   <extension
         id="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.cpndefinition"
         name="CPN"
         point="org.pnml.tools.epnk.pntd">
      <type
            class="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.cpndefinition.impl.CPNImpl"
            description="Coloured Petri Net from CPN Tools">
      </type>
   </extension> 
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Constraints}

We define one constraint for the CPN Type: An Arc must go between a Place and a
Transition. The mechanic for defining this is the EMF extension point
``org.eclipse.emf.validation.constraintProviders''. There are several ways of
defining extensions for this point, some of which are explained in
\cite{kindler2011epnk}. Our extension declaration is shown in listing
\lstref{constraintextension}, and is configured to use a Java class to perform
validation (defined in the \textless{}constraint\textgreater{} element's class
attribute).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML,label=lst:constraintextension,float,
caption=constraintProvider Extension] 
   <extension
         point="org.eclipse.emf.validation.constraintProviders">
      <category

            name="CPN Validation">

            cache="true"

               namespaceUri="http://org.pnml.tools/epnk/pnmlcoremodel">
         </package>
         <constraints
               categories="org.pnml.tools.epnk.validation">
            <constraint
                  class="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.cpndefinition.validation.ArcSourceAndTargetLimitation"
                  id="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.cpndefinition.validation.ArcSourceAndTargetLimitation"
                  isEnabledByDefault="true"
                  lang="Java"
                  mode="Batch"
                  name="Arc source and target limitation"
                  severity="ERROR"
                  statusCode="301">
               <target
                     class="Arc:http://org.cpntools/pragma/epnk/pnktypes/cpndefinition">
               </target>
               <description>
                  An Arc must go between a Place and either a Transition or a Page.
               </description>
               <message>
                  The source and target of arc {0} are not compatible.
               </message>
            </constraint>
         </constraints>
      </constraintProvider>
   </extension>
\end{lstlisting}

This class, ArcSourceAndTargetLimitation, is shown in \lstref{constraintimpl}.
The IValidationContext argument provides both the target model element to be
validated, and facilities for creating an appropriate return object representing
failure or success. The algorithm for checking the arc's source and target is
straightforward.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,label=lst:constraintimpl,float,
caption=Constraint Implementation]
public class ArcSourceAndTargetLimitation extends AbstractModelConstraint {
	public IStatus validate(IValidationContext ctx) {
		EObject eObj = ctx.getTarget();
		if (eObj instanceof Arc) {
			Arc arc = (Arc) eObj;
			Node source = arc.getSource();
			Node target = arc.getTarget();
			
			if (source != null && target != null) {
				PlaceNode pn = null;
				Node other = null;
				if(source instanceof PlaceNode) {
					pn = (PlaceNode) source;
					other = target;
				} else if (target instanceof PlaceNode) {
					pn = (PlaceNode) target;
					other = source;
				}
				if(	pn == null || // there was no Place
					other instanceof PlaceNode) // both are Places
					return ctx.createFailureStatus(new Object[] {arc});
			} 
		} 
		return ctx.createSuccessStatus();
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Annotated CPN Type}
The Annotated CPN Type model is shown in \figref{ann_model_diagram}. It extends
the CPN model to enable annotation of model elements. It also handles references
to ontology documents that define sets of pragmatics.

\fig{PragmaCPNDefinition.pdf}{Annotated CPN model type
diagram}{ann_model_diagram} 

As with the CPN Type Model, we have subclassed the classes of model elements we
need to extend. All of these need to be extended to support the same feature:
Being annotated with pragmatics. Ideally, we would have extended a superclass of
these classes, for instance Node. But this will not work, since model merging is
not possible (as discussed earlier), and subclassing Node will not work, since
existing classes will not be subclasses of our new superclass and therefore not
inherit anything from it. 

We needed to devise a way to extend a group of classes without access to their
superclass, and ideally without copying code between the classes. The solution
was to define an interface that all of the target classes implement. This is the
OntologyMember interface. It defines an operation for getting the OWL Class of
an instance, and since the ontology has been defined with the same names as the
EMF model, this is in most cases equal to the class name. \com{OBS getOWLClass
er ikke i bruk}

OntologyMember has a reference to the Pragma class. The reference is
configured to act as containment, meaning Pragma instances are created as
children of OntologyMember instances. A Pragma instance is a pragmatic, and is
defined by an IRI of a class from an ontology. Like the inscriptions from the
CPN Type, Pragma inherits the Label class to be able to be displayed in the
diagram editor. The text attribute is configured to be virtual, and manually
implemented to return the iri enclosed in \textless\textless and
\textgreater\textgreater.

\subsection{Persisting Pragmatics Sets in the Model}
We have already shown how pragmatics sets can be defined using ontology
documents. But we also need a way to include them in the models we want to
annotate. In other words: a model needs to store which pragmatic sets it
utilises. This is encapsualted in the OntologyDocument class
(\figref{ann_model_diagram}, lower right), which can store the IRI of the
ontology and the path to the document that contains it. This is sufficient to be
able to reload the ontology if the CPN model is closed and later reopened.

These OntologyDocument instances need to be serialised somewhere in the model.
Our first idea was to model them as contained in the PragmaCPN class (i.e.
the Type), however due to the fact that this element is serialised only as an
attribute this was not possible. We decided to create a new class which instance
is contained by the PetriNet class. This is the PragmaticsOntology class
(\figref{ann_model_diagram}, right), and the intention is to have a central
entity to manage the ontologies of the entire net, including loading and
reasoning. For these purposes we defined one property to contain the OWL API
ontology manager, as well as two operations for including new ontology documents
and deduce which pragmatics are valid for a given OntologyMemeber.

\subsection{Adding Pragmatics Sets}\label{sec:menufirsttime}
There needs to be a convenient way to add domain and model specific pragmatics
sets to a model from ontology documents. We decided to extend the context menu
of the PragmaticsOntology class for this purpose.

Eclipse defines several extension points for extending every part of the UI.
Menus in particular have more than one way of being extended. The ePNK manual
suggests using the |org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus| extension point and has an
example of how to implement such an extension. By following this example we have
created the menu command ``Add Ontology'' under the submenu Pragmatics. The
extension is listed in \lstref{addOntologyMenu}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML,float,label=lst:addOntologyMenu,numbers=left,stepnumber=5,
caption=Add Ontology Menu Extension]
   <extension
         point="org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus">
      <objectContribution
            adaptable="false"
            id="ePNK Annotated CPN Type.edit.objectContribution1"
            objectClass="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.pragmacpndefinition.PragmaticsOntology">
         <menu
               id="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.pragmacpndefinition.actions.standardmenu"
               label="Pragmatics"
               path="additions">
            <separator
                  name="group1">
            </separator>
         </menu>
         <action
               class="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.pragmacpndefinition.menu.AddOntologyAction"
               enablesFor="1"
               id="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.pragmacpndefinition.actions.AddOntologyAction"
               label="Add Ontology"
               menubarPath="org.cpntools.pragma.epnk.pnktypes.pragmacpndefinition.actions.standardmenu/group1">
         </action>
      </objectContribution>
   </extension>
\end{lstlisting}

Every menu contribution should supply an |id| attribute to allow it to be
referenced by external code. This is the case for all the elements in this
listing, so we explain it here to avoid repetition.

The extension defines an
|<objectContribution>| element (line 3-8), stating that this menu item should
only appear in the context menu when an object of the specified type is selected. The
|adaptable| attribute is only relevant to IResource objects, but is a required
attribute with a default value of false. The |objectClass| is the
target class that will have its context menu include the new menu, in this case
our PragmaticsOntology class.

We then define a |<menu>| element (line 9-13) that will create a submenu
intended to group together all menu contributions related to pragmatics. The
|label| is simply the label, and |path| specifies where in the parent menu it
should be placed, whith the value ``additions'' being recommended. The menu has
a |separator| child element (line 14-16) that acts as an anchor for positioning
items.

Last, there is the |action| element (starting line 18), defining the menu item
that performs the action. It specifies the |class| that performs an action, which should be a
class implementing the IObjectActionDelegate interface. We have implemented this
as the |AddOntologyAction| class, described below. The |enablesFor| attribute
specifies that the actionis enabled (clickable) when exactly one element is
selected. |label| is the displayed label. |menubarPath| defines
placement by referencing the |id| and |separator| we defined for |<menu>|.

A screenshot of the resulting menu is shown in \figref{addOntologyMenu}. As soon
as the menu should be displayed, an |AddOntologyAction| instance will be created
and configured with |setActivePart()| (which allows us to
get the current shell to be able to display error messages)
and |selectionChanged()| (which gives us the current model selection). These two
methods are shown in \lstref{AddOntologyAction_config}.

\fig{AddOntologyMenu.png}{Add Ontology Menu}{addOntologyMenu}\com{flytt til kap

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,float,label=lst:AddOntologyAction_config,
caption=AddOntologyAction setActivePart() and selectionChanged()]
	private PragmaticsOntology ontology;
	private Shell shell;

	@Override
	public void selectionChanged(IAction action, ISelection selection) {
		ontology = null;
		if (selection instanceof IStructuredSelection) {
			IStructuredSelection structuredSelection = (IStructuredSelection) selection;
			if (structuredSelection.size() == 1
					&& structuredSelection.getFirstElement() instanceof PragmaticsOntology) {
				ontology = (PragmaticsOntology) structuredSelection.getFirstElement();
			}
		}
		action.setEnabled(ontology != null);
	}

	@Override
	public void setActivePart(IAction action, IWorkbenchPart targetPart) {
		shell = targetPart.getSite().getWorkbenchWindow().getShell();
	}
\end{lstlisting}

When the menu item is clicked, the |run()| method will be called, shown in
\lstref{AddOntologyAction_run}. This method uses standard Eclipse classes to
open the file selection dialog shown in \figref{addOntologyDialog}. This dialog
shows the current project's resources and asks the user to select an ontology
document. It does not filter files on their extension, as there exist editors
that save ontologies with different extensions than those defined by W3C.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,float,label=lst:AddOntologyAction_run,
caption=AddOntologyAction run()]
	@Override
	public void run(IAction action) {
		ElementTreeSelectionDialog dialog = new ElementTreeSelectionDialog(
				shell, new WorkbenchLabelProvider(),
				new BaseWorkbenchContentProvider());
		dialog.setTitle("Select an Ontology");
		dialog.setMessage("Select the Ontology document you want to include in the net:");
		
		dialog.setInput(getProject(ontology));
		dialog.open();

		if (dialog.getReturnCode() == Window.OK) {
			Object o = dialog.getFirstResult();
			if (o instanceof IFile) {
				IFile f = (IFile) o;

If the user selects a file and clicks OK, the |run()| method continues by
calling |addOntologyFromFile()| on the selected |PragmaticsOntology|.


\section{Importing from CPN Tools}
Access/CPN is a framework that can parse CPN models saved by CPN Tools and
represent the model with EMF classes. Access/CPN has many additional features
related to the semantics of CPN, but only the model importer is of relevance for
the work in this thesis.

Access/CPN also uses EMF to represent models internally. The EMF model for CPN
models that Access/CPN defines uses many of the same class names as ePNK, which
makes it tedious to write and read code working between the two frameworks due
to the need to use fully qualified classpaths to avoid class name collisions.
Initially we planned to extract the parser source code from Access/CPN and
rewriting it to use the new ePNK CPN Type classes. This plan was later discarded
in favor of depending on the Access/CPN plugin, as Access/CPN has continually
been improved during development of \thename{}, and is now also capable of
parsing graphics data. And by depending on Access/CPN instead of writing our own
parser, we can benefit from further updates and improvements.

The Eclipse Plugin IDE includes several template plugin projects, and one of
them is for creating an Import Wizard, that is a step-by-step dialog for
importing resources into the Eclipse workbench, for instance copying a file from
the file system to a project, or importing entire projects from version control.
The template also preconfigures the plugin manifest with an extension that makes
the wizard available in Eclipse's Import Dialog. This is shown in
\figref{import_wizard} (left)\com{double figure}

The import wizard for importing CPN Tools models only has one step, which
requires the user to select the .cpn file from the file system, and select a
destination in the workspace for the converted model. It is shown in
\figref{import_wizard} (right). After selecting the source file, the wizard
suggests a new name for the converted model based on the original file name but with the
.pnml extension.
\fig{import_wizard.png}{Import Wizard}{import_wizard}

The conversion process is straightforward, the .cpn file is loaded with
Access/CPN, and the resulting model is then converted object by object to the
ePNK Annotated CPN type. The final model also includes a PragmaticsOntology
instance.

\section{Creating Pragmatic Annotations}
We want it to be fast and easy to annotate model elements, and an immediate
example to follow is the way child and sibling elements are added to the model
through context menus. It is possible to create an empty Pragma instance as a
child of an OntologyMember instance without any manual programming; ePNK and EMF
dynamically takes care of that. The user can then manually enter the IRI of the
desired pragmatic.

Our vision was to provide a new menu entry next to New Child and New
Sibling that is dynamically populated with all valid pragmatics for the selected
element.
We have partially achieved this goal through implementation in the PragmaticsOntology
class. It is capable of correctly classifying which pragmatics belong to which
model element, but can not make use of more advanced definitions (like the
previously discussed |:External| pragmatic). The routine for providing the menu
entry can be divided into three parts, and we will explain each part in the
following subsections.

	\subsection{Providing a Dynamic Context Menu}
	\com{TODO}
	
	\subsection{Determining Appropriate Pragmatics}
	
	The algorithm we designed is na\"{\i}ve in its nature: Whenever the Add
	Pragmatics menu is opened, it will create a new manager and load every ontology
	from scratch. 
	
	EMF has an extensive notification framework for reacting to model changes, and
	it should be possible to leverage this to efficiently maintain an accurate
	ontology of the loaded CPN model. But as a proof of concept our approach is
	sufficient.

\section{Defining Model Specific Pragmatics Sets}
\com{vurder å flytte til kap 7}
Creating a set of model specific pragmatics (or any set of pragmatics) is as
simple as writing an ontology for it, but this is not easy if you are not
already familiar with ontologies and the OWL 2 specification and syntaxes. There exist
a number of tools for writing ontologies, 

Dynamically supported in content assist 
If ontology-based, use plugin editor

A specialised tool for creating model specific pragmatics would have ben ideal.
Such a tool would give simple mechanics using GUI controls for specifying which
model elements a pragmatic can be attached to, and which parameters it has. The
Plugin Manifest editor is a good example of what we have in mind. However, this
could not be included for this thesis due to time constraints.
