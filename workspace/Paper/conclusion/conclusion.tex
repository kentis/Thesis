\section{Results}

We have constructed a fully functional proof of concept that demonstrates the
advantage of using ontologies to manage code generation pragmatics and applying
them to a model.

The name \thename{} was decided very late in the development process, which has
led to some naming inconsistencies between it and existing projects, package
names etc.

\subsection{Limitations}

The graphical diagram editor of ePNK has some shortcomings and we do not
conisder it fully mature. Arc appearance is not serialised, making it impossible
to accurately copy layout from CPN Tools. Labels are not attached to their
parent elements, and by default are placed at coordinates 0,0. We look forward
to improvements to this part of ePNK.

Accurate modeling of module instancing (the fact that a module can be a
submodule of several modules) is impractical in the current version of ePNK if
we are to only subclass existing leaf classes.
RefPlaces can only reference a single other place. It could be used to represent
either the port place or the socket place, but either case presents problems. As
a port place, it could be on a module that has several instances, so it would
either need to contain a reference for each instance (which is not possible due
to being limited to 1) or the module itself would need to be duplicated (which
is impractical from a user perspective since all annotations would have to be
placed once on each module). As a socket place, it could be connected to several
submodules (as is the case with the Connection status place in the WebSocket
CPN model) and would need to have a reference to the ports in each of them. 

\section{Further work}

Continue the work of Simonsen, defining more domain-specific pragmatics

Integrating a better ontology editor

Implement structured labels for the CPN Type.

When importing, let user choose between CPN and Pragma CPN. Alternatively,
mechanic for upgrading the Type.
