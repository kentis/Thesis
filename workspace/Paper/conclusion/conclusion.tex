\section{Results}

\subsection{Limitations}

The graphical diagram editor of ePNK has some shortcomings and we do not
conisder it fully mature. Arc appearance is not serialised, making it impossible
to accurately copy layout from CPN Tools. Labels are not attached to their
parent elements, and by default are placed at coordinates 0,0. We look forward
to improvements to this part of ePNK.

\section{Further work}

Continue the work of Simonsen, defining more domain-specific pragmatics

Integrating a better ontology editor

Implement structured labels for the CPN Type.

When importing, let user choose between CPN and Pragma CPN. Alternatively,
mechanic for upgrading the Type.
