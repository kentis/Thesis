\chapter{Downloading \thename{}}

At the time of writing we are using a development version of ePNK that is yet to
be published, and are therefore unfortunately unable to publish \thename{} as a
plugin that can be installed from an update site through the Eclipse Plugin Manager. However,
the source code is available at
\mbox{\url{https://github.com/stylpe/Thesis/tree/master/workspace}} and can be
imported into Eclipse as a collection of Eclipse Projects.

ePNK is scheduled to release version 0.9.3 later this year, and at that time we
will add instructions for installing \thename{} on the URL above.
