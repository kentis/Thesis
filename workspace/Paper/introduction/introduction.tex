\section{Thesis Aim}

What is a good way of annotating Coloured Petri Nets with code generation
pragmatics?

This thesis seeks to answer this question by creating a prototype application
and using it to annotate a test model.

The framework should be capable of supporting several classes of pragmatics, 
categorised into General, Domain Specific, and Model Specific Pragmatics.

It should be possible to import CPN models created in CPN Tools. Annotations are
placed through a tree editor, and also, if possible, through a graphical diagram
editor. Errors highlighting?

Finally, there should be an easy way to invoke the code generator from the
editor.

and application of state space analysis using the WebSocket Protocol as the
subject.

all technologies used to build then prototype, including the Eclipse Platform
and its modules, which make up the foundation of the prototype.
