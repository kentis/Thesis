  abstract = 	 {Protocol software is important for much of the computer
                  based infrastructure deployed today, and will remain so
                  for the foreseeable future.  With current modelling
                  techniques for communication protocols, important
                  properties are modelled and verified.  However, most
                  implementations are being done by hand even if good
                  formal models exist.  This paper discusses some of the
                  challenges in modelling and automatically generating
                  software for protocols.  The challenges are discussed
                  using the Kao-Chow authentication protocol as a running
                  example by outlining an approach for generating protocol
                  software for different platforms based upon Coloured
                  Petri Nets (CPN).  The basic idea of the approach is to
                  annotate the CPN models with pragmatics which can be used
                  in a code generator when mapping the constructs of the
                  CPN model onto the target platform.}

@article{osi7,
    abstract = {{Considering the urgency of the need for standards which would allow constitution of heterogeneous computer networks, ISO created a new subcommittee for "Open Systems Interconnection" (ISO/ TC97/SC 16) in 1977. The first priority of subcommittee 16 was to develop an architecture for open systems interconnection which could serve as a framework for the definition of standard protocols. As a result of 18 months of studies and discussions, SC16 adopted a layered architecture comprising seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application). In July 1979 the specifications of this architecture, established by SC16, were passed under the name of "OSI Reference Model" to Technical Committee 97 "Data Processing" along with recommendations to start officially, on this basis, a set of protocols standardization projects to cover the most urgent needs. These recommendations were adopted by T.C97 at the end of 1979 as the basis for the following development of standards for Open Systems Interconnectlon within ISO. The OSI Reference Model was also recognized by CCITT Rapporteur's Group on "Layered Model for Public Data Network Services." This paper presents the model of architecture for Open Systems Interconnection developed by SC16. Some indications are also given on the initial set of protocols which will-likely be developed in this OSI Reference Model.}},
