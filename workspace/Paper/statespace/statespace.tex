\chapter{State space analysis of the CPN Web Socket Protocol}\label{chap:statespace}One of the advantages about Coloured Petri Nets is state space analysis, whichcan tell you about a model's behavioural properties, and can help you locateerrors and increase confidence in the correctness of the model.\section{State space generation}A state space is a directed graph where a node represents a reachable marking (astate) and an arc represents an occurring binding element (a transition firingwith specific values bound to its variables). CPN Tools generates the statespace using Breadth-first-search. Once generated, the state space can be visualised directly in CPN Tools.Starting with the node for the initial state, one can pick a node and show allnodes that are reachable from it, and in this way explore the state spacevisually. This can be very tedious and unmanageable for complex state spaces,though, and instead it is usually better to use automation to analyse the statespace.	\subsection{Strongly Connected Component graph}	In graph theory, a strongly connected component (SCC) is a maximal subgraph	where all nodes are reachable from each other. A SCC graph consists of each	SCC in the graph connected with arcs that go between nodes that belong to	different SCCs. Such a SCC graph is acyclic. A trivial SCC contains only one	node.		By calculating the SCC graph of the state space, some of the further	analysis becomes simpler and faster, such as determining reachability and	looping.	\subsection{Limitations}		\subsubsection{State space explosion}		The biggest drawback of state space analysis is the potential size a state space		can achieve. The number of nodes and arcs increase with the number of starting		system parameters (initial marking colors), usually in an exponential relationship. 				This can be remedied by picking smaller configurations,  that encapsulate		different parts of the system. This was necessary with the WebSocket Protocol		model, as the state space took too long to generate.				A variant of this is situations where colour tokens can be generated an		unlimited amount of times, making the state space infinite. This can be		remedied by modifying the net to limit the number of simultaneous tokens in		the offending place.		 		\subsubsection{Non-deterministic behaviour}		A model that incorporates random values is not fit for computing a state		space, as the number of possible bindings are arbitrary for a given state		depending on the possible random values. Some values might not get used. Other		times there is an infinite number of possible values (like a floating point		number).				This can sometimes be alleviated by changing the behaviour to be		deterministic, for example by replacing the random function with a small color		set, such as an index or an integer with bounds. This lets the state space		generator create bindings for every possible value. 				For the WebSocket Protocol model, this was a problem for the masking key in		WebSocket frames, which is supposed to be a random 4-byte string. The		randomisation function was simply changed to always return four zeros.\section{State space report}Once the state space has been generated, CPN Tools lets the user save a reportas a text document. The report is split into parts that each describe differentaspects about the state space.To explain each section of the report, a simple report has been generated whereno messages are set to be sent. Thus, the only thing that will happen is that aconnection will be established.		\subsection{Statistics}	The first section describes general statistics about the state space.	\begin{lstlisting}[language={}]  State Space     Nodes:  17     Arcs:   16     Secs:   0     Status: Full  Scc Graph     Nodes:  17     Arcs:   16     Secs:   0	\end{lstlisting}	This state space has 17 possible markings. We see that it takes 16 transitions	to fully establish a connection.		There is one more node than there are arcs, which means this graph is a tree. The Secs	field shows that it took less than one second to calculate this state space,	while the Status field tells whether the report is generated from a partial or	full state space.		We also see that the Scc Graph has the same number of nodes and arcs, meaning	that there are no loops in the state space.		\subsection{Boundedness Properties}	This section describes the smallest and biggest possible number of markings for	each place in the model, as well as the actual markings these places can have.	The text has been truncated for readability.	\begin{lstlisting}[language={}]  Best Integer Bounds                             Upper      Lower     ClientApplication'Active_Connection 1                             1          0     ClientApplication'Conn_Result 1                             1          0     ClientApplication'Connection_failed 1                             0          0     ClientApplication'Messages_received 1                             1          1     ClientApplication'Messages_to_be_sent 1                             0          0     .....  Best Upper Multi-set Bounds     ClientApplication'Active_Connection 1                         1`()     ClientApplication'Conn_Result 1                         1`success     ClientApplication'Connection_failed 1                         empty     ClientApplication'Messages_received 1                         1`[]     ClientApplication'Messages_to_be_sent 1                         empty     .....     ClientWebSocket'Connection_status 1                         1`CONN_OPEN     .....     ServerWebSocket'Connection_Status 1                         1`CONN_OPEN     .....  Best Lower Multi-set Bounds     ClientApplication'Active_Connection 1                         empty     ClientApplication'Conn_Result 1                         empty     ClientApplication'Connection_failed 1                         empty     ClientApplication'Messages_received 1                         1`[]     ClientApplication'Messages_to_be_sent 1                         empty     .....     ClientWebSocket'Connection_status 1                         empty     .....     ServerWebSocket'Connection_Status 1                         empty     .....	\end{lstlisting}		Many places show a lower and upper bound of 1. This shows a weakness	in the approach of using lists to facilitate ordered processing of tokens: We	can't see the actual number of tokens that are in the place, because	technically there is just a list there. 		Apart from that, we see that both the client and the server has an open	connection at some point.		\subsection{Home Properties}	This section shows all home markings. A home marking is a marking that can	always be reached no matter where we are in the state space.	\begin{lstlisting}[language={}]  Home Markings     [17]	\end{lstlisting}	We see that there	is one such marking at node 17. From earlier we know that the state space is a	tree, and if this node is always reachable it must be a leaf and all the other nodes	must be in a chain. This tells us that there is only one possible sequence of	transitions to establish a connection. We can then confidently say that this	works correctly.		\subsection{Liveness Properties}	This section . Some of the transitions have ben elided for readability.	\begin{lstlisting}[language={}]  Dead Markings     [17]  Dead Transition Instances     ClientApplication'Fail 1     ClientApplication'Receive_data 1     ClientApplication'Send_data 1     ClientWebSocket'Filter_messages 1     .....  Live Transition Instances     None	\end{lstlisting}	A dead marking is a marking where no other markings can be reached. In other	words, there are no transitions for which there are valid bindings, and the	system is effectivley stopped. For our example, our home marking is also a dead	marking, confirming that this is a leaf node in the tree. 		We also get a listing of dead transition instances, which are transitions that	never have any valid bindings and are thus never fired. This is expected for	many of the transitions in this example, since we're not sending any kind of	message.		Last, there are live transition instances. A transition t is	live if we from any reachable marking can find an occurrence sequence containing t.	Our example has no such transition, which follows trivially from the fact that	there is a dead marking.	\subsection{Fairness Properties}	This section does not apply to our model since it contains no loops. The report	only has this to say:	\begin{lstlisting}[language={}]	No infinite occurrence sequences.	\end{lstlisting}	We will not explain more about this, and instead refer you to \cite{cpn_book}	chapter 7 for more information.	\section{TODO:} Skrive om resten av analysene.Flette inn dette:\subsection{Error discovery}An error in the model was discovered this way, in the Unwrap and Receive module,where the pong reply was adding a new list instead of appending to the old onein outgoing messages.
